I would like to build an application that helps me manage ingredients in my fridge and provide guidance on recipes with relevant ingredients
The user will provide details on ingredients in their fridge and the application will provide suggestions on what recipes can be made with those ingredients
The user can also pick a recipe and it will identify if the ingredients needed are present in the fridge
The application can also generate a schedule of meals based on existing recipes and ingredients in the fridge
It can also track the ingredient inventory levels of the fridge and suggest what items to purchase in the next grocery store trip
Recipes can be added by uploading photos of a recipe. The application will store relevant information from the recipe like ingredients, recipe name, and cooking times
Fridge ingredients can be manually input by the user with details like ingredient name and amount
